# CAN Task
This task is one of the tasks in "SiemensEDA Academy of Excellence" Program from Eng.Youssef Toma

1. CAN Driver Implemented from scratch **(Bare-Metal Code)**
2. GPIO and System Control Drivers didn't implement due to lack of time but i didn't used predefined APIs to interace with them.

**Note**: This driver didn't tested yet due to lack of the hardware, so it might have some logical issues.
